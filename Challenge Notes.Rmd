v<- c("Stately,","plump","Buck","Mulligan","came","from","the","stairhead,","bearing","a","bowl","of","lather","on","which","a","mirror","and","a","razor","lay","crossed")

v[(from=1, to=22, by=3)]

Okay that didn't work. Came up with error message saying I had an extra comma. 

v[seq(from=1, to=22, by=3)]

It worked! But it started with the first word, not the third one. If I change the from=1 to from=0, it starts with the third word "Buck"

m<-matrix(data=1:80, nrow=8, ncol=10, byrow=FALSE)

x<-m[ ,2,3,6]
I can't figure out how assign multiple columns of data as a single variable

a<- array (data=400:1, dim= c(5,5,4,4))

a[1,1,1,2]
 =300
a[2,3,2, ]
 =364 264 164 64
a[1:5, 1:5,3,3]
 =the section of the matrix that is 3,3; 150:126
